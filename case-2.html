                          The first case of the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic in India was reported on 30 January 2020, originating from China. As of 5 April 2020, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have confirmed a total of 3,577 cases, 275 recoveries (including 1 migration) and 83 deaths in the country.Experts suggest the number of infections could be a substantial underestimate, as India's testing rates are among the lowest in the world.The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7, significantly lower than in the worst affected countries.
                          The World Health Organisation chief executive director of health emergencies programme Michael Ryan said that India had "tremendous capacity" to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and, as the second most populous country, will have enormous impact on the world's ability to deal with it. Other commentators worried about the economic devastation caused by the lockdown, which has huge effects on informal workers, micro and small enterprises, farmers and the self-employed, who are left with no livelihood in the absence of transportation and access to markets. The lockdown otherwise has been justified by government and other agencies for being preemptive to prevent India from entering a higher stage which could make handling very difficult and cause even more losses thereafter.
